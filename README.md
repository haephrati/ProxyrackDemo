# Proxyrack Demo
ProxyRack is one of the few proxy service providers which provide a residential VPN service. 
I came across their services while working on a Facebook data scrapper. 
ProxyRack claims to serve more than 800 million API requests per day, and while the lack of details about the company doesnâ€™t inspire confidence, its pricing and features make it an attractive option worth exploring.

:point_right: Proxycrack Open Source code samples can be found [here](https://github.com/proxyrackdev/API-Examples).

Proxyrack Demo is a Command Line based software component created for the purpose of demonstration of the ABBYY OCR SDK using C++ (Visual Studio C++) and LibCurl.
