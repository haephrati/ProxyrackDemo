# Proxyrack Demo
ProxyRack is one of the few proxy service providers which provide a residential VPN service. 
I came across their services while working on a Facebook data scrapper. 
ProxyRack claims to serve more than 800 million API requests per day, and while the lack of details about the company doesnâ€™t inspire confidence, its pricing and features make it an attractive option worth exploring.

:point_right: Proxycrack Open Source code samples can be found [here](https://github.com/proxyrackdev/API-Examples).

### Video Demo ###
In this demo, Proxycrack is used as part of a software for scrapping all comments of a given Facebook post.
